## Overview

### About this package 
This package provides functions to fetch, explore, and reproduce the processed data and downstream
analysis results presented in the main paper for the first 
large-scale multi-omic multi-tissue endurance exercise training study conducted 
in young adult rats by the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium 
(MoTrPAC). See our publication in [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06877-w).
**See the [vignette](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6mo/articles/MotrpacRatTraining6mo.html) for examples of how to use this package.**

While some of the functions in this package can be used by themselves, they
were primarily written to analyze data in the 
[MotrpacRatTraining6moData](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6moData)
R package. See examples of how these data can be analyzed *without* this package in the 
[MotrpacRatTraining6moData vignette](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6moData/articles/MotrpacRatTraining6moData.html).

### About MoTrPAC
MoTrPAC is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform 
preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the 
"molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans. 
The program's goal is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after 
exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how physical activity 
improves and preserves health. The six-year program is the largest targeted NIH 
investment of funds into the mechanisms of how physical activity improves health 
and prevents disease. See [motrpac.org](https://www.motrpac.org/) and 
[motrpac-data.org](https://motrpac-data.org/) for more details. 

## Installation
Install this package with `devtools`. Because installing this package also installs 
[MotrpacRatTraining6moData](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6moData) as a dependency, 
Mac users should additionally extend their `timeout` to prevent an error caused by the amount of time
it takes to download `MoTrPAC/MotrpacRatTraining6moData@HEAD`. 
```r
options(timeout=1e5) # recommended for Mac users
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("MoTrPAC/MotrpacRatTraining6mo")
```

[MotrpacRatTraining6moData](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6moData)
is a critical dependency for this package. If the above command has issues installing
this dependency, follow [these instructions](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6moData/index.html#installation) to install 
[MotrpacRatTraining6moData](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6moData)
separately. 

## Getting help 
**See the [vignette](https://motrpac.github.io/MotrpacRatTraining6mo/articles/MotrpacRatTraining6mo.html) 
for examples of how to use this package.**
