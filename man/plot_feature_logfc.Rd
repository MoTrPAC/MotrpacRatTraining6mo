  feature_ID = NULL,
  feature = NULL,
  title = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{assay}{NULL or character, assay abbreviation, one of \link[MotrpacRatTraining6moData:ASSAY_ABBREV]{MotrpacRatTraining6moData::ASSAY_ABBREV}}

\item{tissue}{NULL or character, tissue abbreviation, one of \link[MotrpacRatTraining6moData:TISSUE_ABBREV]{MotrpacRatTraining6moData::TISSUE_ABBREV}}

\item{feature_ID}{NULL or character, MoTrPAC feature identifier}

\item{feature}{NULL or character, unique feature identifier in the format '\link[MotrpacRatTraining6moData:ASSAY_ABBREV]{MotrpacRatTraining6moData::ASSAY_ABBREV};\link[MotrpacRatTraining6moData:TISSUE_ABBREV]{MotrpacRatTraining6moData::TISSUE_ABBREV};feature_ID' only for training-regulated features at 5\% IHW FDR. For redundant differential features, 'feature_ID' is prepended with the specific platform to make unique identifiers. See \link[MotrpacRatTraining6moData:REPEATED_FEATURES]{MotrpacRatTraining6moData::REPEATED_FEATURES} for details.. If NULL, \code{assay}, \code{tissue}, and
\code{feature_ID} must all be specified.}

\item{title}{character, plot title. By default, the plot ID is \code{feature}.
If \code{add_gene_symbol = TRUE}, the gene symbol is also added to the plot title.}

\item{add_gene_symbol}{bool, whether to add corresponding gene symbol to
plot title. Default: FALSE}

\item{facet_by_sex}{bool, whether to facet the plot by sex. If \code{TRUE},
lines are colored by tissue. If \code{FALSE}, lines are colored by sex. Default: FALSE}

\item{scale_x_by_time}{bool, whether to scale the x-axis by time. If \code{FALSE},
space the time points (0w, 1w, 2w, 4w, 8w) evenly. Default: TRUE}

\item{add_adj_p}{bool, whether to include the training adjusted p-value (AKA selection FDR)
in the plot subtitle. Default: TRUE}

\item{metareg}{bool, whether to use the meta-regression version of differential
analysis results for metabolomics data. If \code{FALSE}, use the redundant,
non-meta-analyzed results. Default: TRUE}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link[=get_file_from_url]{get_file_from_url()}}}
}
\value{
a \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}} object or NULL if the data cannot be found

\description{
Plot timewise differential analysis results for a single feature.
Points are log fold-changes, and error bars indicate standard errors.
