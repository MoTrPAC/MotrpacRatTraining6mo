Description: The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity
    Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to study the molecular changes that occur
    during and after exercise and ultimately advance the understanding of
    how physical activity improves and preserves health. This package
    provides convenient analysis functions to explore the multi-tissue,
    multi-omic data generated by MoTrPAC's endurance exercise training
    study in 6-month-old rats.
